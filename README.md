# DeEvolve: LLM-driven Evolutionary Optimization for Truck-Drone Delivery

## Overview

We propose **DeEvolve**, a novel framework that integrates large language models with evolutionary computation to automatically optimize truck-drone last-mile delivery route planning algorithms. The study validates the method through experiments on the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem (FSTSP), Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The results demonstrate that this approach effectively enhances the performance of the original algorithms, particularly for the structurally complex FSTSP, where its algorithm decomposition strategy exhibits unique advantages. This work provides new insights and methodologies for the application of artificial intelligence in logistics and delivery.

## Methods Included

This project contains the source code files and corresponding data for five methods tested on the FSTSP problem:
- **wode** - DeEvolve variant without decomposition
- **DeEvolve** - Our proposed framework with full decomposition
- **EoH_CP** - EoH adapted for complete programs
- **wosel** - Without module selection
- **wotext** - Without text description generation

## Quick Start

### Running Evolution Process

1. **Navigate to Method Directory**: Each method has its own directory containing a `run.py` file.

2. **Prepare Data**: 
   - Copy your evolution data from the `data` folder
   - Replace the `points` section in both `code_init.py` and `evaluate.py` files within the corresponding method's directory

3. **Configure API Settings**:
   - Update the LLM-related parameters in the `paras` section of `run.py` with your own API information

4. **Execute Evolution**:
   - Run `run.py` to initiate the evolution operation
   - The optimal program will be output upon completion

### Using Evolved Examples

The `examples` directory contains five files, each representing an example program evolved by one of the five methods:

1. **Select Example**: Choose the example file corresponding to your desired method
2. **Update Data**: Replace the `points` data in the file with your own dataset
3. **Run Algorithm**: Execute the file to obtain the route generated by the corresponding algorithm
